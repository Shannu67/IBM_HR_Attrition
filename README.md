**Dashboard Insights**:
- **Total Employees**: 1470 | **Attrition Count**: 237 | **Attrition Rate**: 16.12%
- **Overtime Employees**: 30.53% attrition rate
- **Low Income Group**: 28.61% attrition vs 12% for top earners
- **Low Satisfaction**: 83% of employees who quit rated Job Satisfaction ≤ 2
- **Departmental Attrition**: Sales and HR departments lead in turnover

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Identify factors contributing to employee attrition.
- Use Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) for data-driven EDA and modeling.
- Build a logistic regression model and optimize it using SMOTE.
- Visualize business-critical insights in Power BI for HR strategy alignment.

## 🔍 Key Findings

| Metric | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| Attrition Rate | 16.12% overall |
| High-Risk Group | Employees working overtime (30.53% attrition) |
| Low Income Group | 28.6% attrition vs 12% for top earners |
| Low Satisfaction | 83% of those who left had Job Satisfaction ≤ 2 |
| Department Hotspots | Sales and HR show highest turnover |

## 📈 Machine Learning Summary

- ✅ Logistic Regression with and without SMOTE balancing
- 🎯 Accuracy: 100% (post-balancing) — shows high model fit, but potential overfitting
- 🔍 Key Predictors: Age, OverTime, DistanceFromHome, JobSatisfaction

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Power BI: DAX, slicers, KPI cards, charts, and visual storytelling
- Jupyter Notebook + Google Colab
